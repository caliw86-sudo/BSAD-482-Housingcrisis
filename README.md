Housing Supply Strategy in North Vancouver: Densification vs. Greenfield Constraints

​​## Decision Statement
Should the Director of Planning for the City of North Vancouver prioritize missing-middle densification within existing neighbourhoods to address housing affordability under land and infrastructure constraints between 2026 and 2029?

## Executive Summary
The City of North Vancouver faces persistent housing affordability challenges driven by strong regional demand, geographic constraints, and limited developable land. As part of the Metro Vancouver region, the city attracts residents seeking proximity to employment centres, transit access, and urban amenities. However, physical barriers such as mountains and waterways, combined with an already built-out urban form, leave little opportunity for greenfield suburban expansion. As a result, housing supply has struggled to keep pace with demand, contributing to low vacancy rates and rising housing costs.
The Director of Planning must decide whether to more aggressively prioritize missing-middle densification, including duplexes, triplexes, secondary suites, coach houses, and small apartment buildings, as the primary strategy to increase housing supply. While densification offers potential benefits such as more efficient land use, reduced sprawl, and better use of existing infrastructure, it also introduces tensions related to neighbourhood opposition, infrastructure strain, and development approval delays. These factors create uncertainty around whether densification policies can deliver meaningful affordability improvements in the short to medium term.
This project applies decision intelligence and systems thinking to support this planning decision. Rather than focusing solely on descriptive housing trends, the analysis examines how feedback loops between housing demand, prices, political resistance, infrastructure capacity, and approval timelines shape outcomes over time. The objective is to provide evidence-based insights that help the Director of Planning choose a strategy that improves affordability while remaining feasible within local and provincial constraints.
