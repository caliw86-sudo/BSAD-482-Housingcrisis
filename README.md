Project Title
Housing Supply Strategy in North Vancouver: Densification vs. Greenfield Constraints

​​## Decision Statement
Should the Director of Planning for the City of North Vancouver prioritize missing-middle densification within established neighbourhoods or continue limiting growth given land and infrastructure constraints in the 2026–2029 housing strategy?
## Executive Summary
The City of North Vancouver faces intense housing affordability pressures driven by population growth, limited developable land, and its proximity to Metro Vancouver’s regional labour market. As housing demand continues to outpace supply, rents and home prices have increased sharply, placing growing strain on residents, employers, and municipal services. The Director of Planning must recommend a housing supply strategy that meaningfully addresses affordability while respecting physical, political, and infrastructure constraints unique to the city.
Unlike many municipalities, North Vancouver has minimal greenfield land available for suburban expansion. As a result, the primary policy lever available to planners is missing-middle densification—including duplexes, triplexes, four-plexes, secondary suites, and small apartment buildings within existing neighbourhoods. While this approach can increase supply without expanding the urban footprint, it often encounters neighbourhood opposition, infrastructure capacity concerns, and lengthy approval processes.
This decision is complex because increasing housing supply can trigger reinforcing feedback loops. Rising prices increase political pressure and resistance to change, which can slow approvals and constrain supply further. Infrastructure limitations and construction delays add additional friction. This project applies decision intelligence and systems thinking to map these dynamics and evaluate how densification policies may perform over time. The goal is to provide evidence-based insights that help the Planning Director choose a strategy that improves affordability while remaining feasible within North Vancouver’s constraints.
