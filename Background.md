# Background: Housing Supply Decision in the City of North Vancouver
The City of North Vancouver is experiencing sustained housing affordability challenges driven by strong regional demand, geographic constraints, and limited developable land. As part of the Metro Vancouver region, the city attracts residents seeking proximity to employment centres, transit access, and urban amenities. However, North Vancouver is physically constrained by mountains, waterways, and surrounding municipalities, leaving little opportunity for outward suburban expansion. As a result, housing supply has not kept pace with demand, contributing to low rental vacancy rates and rising housing costs (Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation [CMHC], 2023).

This decision matters because housing affordability has wide-ranging social, economic, and fiscal implications. Rising rents and home prices place pressure on renters and first-time buyers, increase the risk of displacement, and limit the ability of local employers to attract and retain workers. From a municipal perspective, constrained housing supply can increase commuting distances, strain transportation networks, and undermine long-term community sustainability. The Director of Planning must therefore recommend a housing strategy that improves affordability while remaining feasible within local infrastructure, political, and regulatory constraints.
The decision is difficult due to significant tradeoffs between growth, community acceptance, and capacity. With minimal greenfield land available, missing-middle densification—including duplexes, triplexes, secondary suites, coach houses, and small apartment buildings—represents the primary mechanism for increasing housing supply. Densification can make more efficient use of existing infrastructure and limit environmental impacts associated with sprawl. However, it often encounters neighbourhood opposition related to concerns over traffic congestion, parking availability, school capacity, and changes to neighbourhood character. These concerns can lead to longer development approval timelines, reducing the short-term effectiveness of densification policies.

Infrastructure constraints further complicate the decision. Water, sewer, transportation, and community services in North Vancouver were largely designed for lower-density development. Increasing density may require costly infrastructure upgrades, raising questions about municipal fiscal capacity and the timing of investments. Construction labour shortages and rising material costs also introduce delays between policy decisions and completed housing units, creating uncertainty around when affordability improvements might materialize.
Recent planning decisions highlight these tensions. In December 2024, the District of North Vancouver Council approved “Option B” of its Official Community Plan (OCP) update to meet provincially mandated housing targets of 22,369 new homes by 2041. Option B largely continues the municipality’s existing housing strategy, concentrating growth in key town and village centres and maintaining zoning changes introduced in 2024 that allow up to three units in single-family zones (North Shore News, 2024). A more aggressive alternative that would have allowed greater density along corridors and in additional neighbourhoods was rejected, reflecting political resistance to more rapid change.

This decision context is also shaped by recent provincial housing legislation in British Columbia, which requires municipalities to plan for 20 years of housing needs and permit increased density, particularly small-scale multi-unit housing. According to the District of North Vancouver (2025), recent OCP updates confirm that existing land-use designations and zoning bylaws have sufficient theoretical capacity to meet long-term housing targets. However, municipal leaders have expressed concern that provincial mandates prioritize housing supply without adequately addressing infrastructure funding or local planning autonomy.

Key stakeholders affected by this decision include renters and prospective homebuyers facing affordability challenges, existing residents concerned about neighbourhood change, developers responding to regulatory incentives and approval timelines, municipal taxpayers funding infrastructure upgrades, and provincial authorities shaping the regulatory environment. This project applies systems thinking and decision intelligence to help the Director of Planning understand how these competing forces interact, informing a realistic and evidence-based housing supply strategy for North Vancouver.
