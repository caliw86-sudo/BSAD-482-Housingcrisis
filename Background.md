# Background: Housing Supply Decision in the City of North Vancouver
Housing Supply Decision in the City of North Vancouver
The City of North Vancouver is facing persistent housing affordability challenges driven by strong regional demand, limited land availability, and geographic constraints. As part of the Metro Vancouver region, North Vancouver attracts residents seeking proximity to employment centres, transit, and amenities. However, the municipality is physically constrained by mountains, waterways, and surrounding jurisdictions, leaving little undeveloped land available for expansion. As a result, housing supply growth has struggled to keep pace with demand, contributing to low rental vacancy rates and high housing costs.
This decision matters because housing affordability has significant social, economic, and fiscal implications. Rising rents and home prices place pressure on renters and first-time buyers, contribute to displacement, and affect the ability of local employers to attract and retain workers. From a municipal perspective, limited housing supply can increase commuting pressures, strain infrastructure, and challenge long-term community sustainability. The Director of Planning must recommend a housing strategy that meaningfully increases supply while remaining feasible within infrastructure, political, and regulatory constraints.
The decision is particularly difficult due to competing tradeoffs between growth, affordability, and local capacity. With virtually no greenfield land available, missing-middle densification including duplexes, triplexes, secondary suites, coach houses, and small apartment buildings represents the primary mechanism for increasing housing supply. While densification can make more efficient use of existing infrastructure and limit urban sprawl, it often encounters neighbourhood opposition related to traffic, parking, school capacity, and changes to neighbourhood character. These concerns can slow development approvals, weakening the short-term effectiveness of densification policies.
Recent planning decisions highlight these tensions. In December 2024, the District of North Vancouver Council approved “Option B” of its Official Community Plan (OCP) update to meet provincially mandated housing targets of 22,369 new homes by 2041. Option B largely continues the municipality’s existing housing strategy, concentrating growth in key town and village centres and maintaining zoning changes introduced in 2024 that allow up to three units in single-family zones, including secondary suites and coach houses (North Shore News, 2024). Council rejected a more aggressive alternative, Option A, which would have allowed greater density and housing diversity along corridors and within additional neighbourhoods.
The decision to proceed with Option B reflects broader challenges created by recent provincial housing legislation. The Province of British Columbia has enacted multiple bills requiring municipalities to plan for 20 years of housing needs and permit increased density, particularly small-scale multi-unit housing and transit-oriented development. According to the District of North Vancouver (2025), recent OCP updates acknowledge new provincial authorities and confirm that existing land-use designations and zoning bylaws have sufficient capacity to meet long-term housing targets without increasing density beyond current plans. However, municipal leaders have expressed concern that provincial legislation prioritizes housing supply without adequately addressing infrastructure capacity, transportation upgrades, or local planning autonomy.
Key stakeholders affected by this decision include renters and prospective homebuyers facing affordability challenges, existing residents concerned about neighbourhood change, developers responding to regulatory incentives and approval timelines, and municipal taxpayers funding infrastructure upgrades. Provincial authorities also play a critical role by shaping the regulatory framework within which local planning decisions are made.
This project applies systems thinking and decision intelligence to help the Director of Planning understand how densification policies interact with demand pressures, infrastructure capacity, and political resistance. By identifying key feedback loops and constraints, the analysis aims to support a realistic and evidence-based housing supply strategy for North Vancouver.
